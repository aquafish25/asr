I’m working on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for atypical speech — a challenging and exciting area! 🔍 Since this is ongoing research,  I can’t spill all the beans just yet 🤫

But don’t worry! This repository is here to serve as a simple and solid starting point for anyone interested in building their own ASR system.

Happy coding! 🚀🎤
